# hello-world
Coming back to github after many years

### About myself

I am a mostly retired statistican.  I am trying to see how using github can help with managing the few projects I am working on now.  I will eventually need to create private sites, which I guess means that I will have to pay.

### Next plans

When I work through this initial hello-world exercise I am going to create a couple projects

* First will be Fiddler on the Proof items, and the first item will be the Squid game

* Second will be some items related to generalized paired comparisons, including an upload of my current code.
